  Summary
  Our games theme involves killer clowns, cats, and fantasy for the most part.
  The player will be able to build a character with some classes as options. The
  world has magic and clowns involved. Clowns act as the player's main enemy. The
  player interacts with the world by placed in rooms that just lead into more rooms. 
  Normally to exit the room a task/fight/puzzle must be done. The player is 
  accompanied/follows a cat. Plots in the story are affected by the players 
  relationship with the cat. *still very much in development*
